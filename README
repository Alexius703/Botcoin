Botcoin README

INTRO
-----
This is an IRC bot in PHP that pulls down and organizes various Bitcoin related
market data. It also allows setting of triggers / alerts for price points. I plan
on adding a bunch of functionality in the comming weeks, so stay tuned.


INSTALLATION
-------------
1) Rename config-fillmein.ini to config.ini
2) Edit config.ini and set your options.

port    = 6667                   # an interger port
host    = irc.whatever.net       # a qualified hostname
channel = somechannel            # channel, no # prefix required
key     = OPTIONAL               # channel (+k) optional
name    = myName                 # the name of the bot (whois)
nick    = My-NickyNick           # the nick (shown in channel, /msg, etc)
owner   = "owner!shell@host.com" # the owner. Make sure you get this correct.
                                 # should be in the format "nick!user@sub.tld.com"
triggerUpdateFreq = 30           # How often to check the triggers programmatically.
tickerUpdateFreq  = 30           # How often to update ticker data (Can't be > MtGox limit).

3) Make bootstrap file executable:
    	shell> chmod +x run.php
4) Run the bot
	shell> ./run.php >> /dev/null
5) Enjoy!
